None of the parts below are compulsory for a PR, but a good template to follow in general. Developers are free to add in or remove sections as stated below. 

## Context
Here you should write the context/background of the code changes, a good format to follow is.

* What's the problem/feature
* How what you are doing solves/adds that problem/feature
* Anything you feel will help to understand your changes

## Links
Here you should add links that are related to this Pull Request. For example:

* Issue Links
* Commit Links
* Documentation Links

## Media
Normally, if you are working on a feature that has a UI component, you
should add a gif or a video of the behaviour. If the behaviour is not
that complex and you feel like an image will do the trick, then it's
fine. For gifs/videos we use [recordit.co](http://recordit.co)/

If it's a feature without UI, you can ignore this part.

## Reviewers
Here you tag all the persons you feel should review the ticket (your project teammates for example)
